# Providing Data-driven Suggestions for Human Resources to Increase Employee Retention


## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the employee dataset and build a predictive model that can provide insights about turnover over Salifort Motors employees. For the purposes of this project, the employee turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go. 

The XGBoost outperforms the other models.  It achieved an AUC score of 90.43% on the test set, which means that the model is highly capable of distinguishing between employees who will leave or stay in the company.


## Business Understanding   
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company and answer the question: **"What's likely to make the employee leave the company?"** 

They surveyed a sample of employees, but now they don't know what to do with the collected data. As a data professional, HR asked for help with the following goals in mind:
1. Analyze the data
2. Build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company
3. Provide data-driven suggestions to improve employee retention

The reason for the predictive model is that if the model can predict employees who are likely to quit, it is also possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees. 

## Data Understanding

The dataset contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below.
